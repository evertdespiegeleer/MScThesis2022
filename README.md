This repository hosts the files relevant to my master's dissertation: "A system to project milling and drilling paths in electrical panel CNC machining". The thesis was submitted in January 2022 at Ghent University in order to obtain the academic degree of Master of Science in Electromechanical Engineering Technology.

All relevant files are available as a bundled zip-file: [bundle.zip](bundle.zip).

Due to the confidential nature of the project, the bundle is encrypted. Instructions on decryption are found in the thesis.
